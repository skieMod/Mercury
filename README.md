# What is Mercury?
Mercury is a simple, lightweight, **Minecraft Performance Modpack**, whose goal is to provide players with a significant FPS boost, while sustaining the quality and charm of Minecraft. It is created strictly for performance; **no Quality of Life, no OptiFine features, no game-breaking visual adjustments, just speed**. You can use Mercury both by itself for a vanilla FPS boost, as well as a foundation, a base model you can add onto to create your own mod pack. This is why **Mercury has support for both Fabric and Forge (never seen before)**, so that you can have increased FPS with any mods you desire.

Our Modpack is actually named after the Roman God of Speed, Mercury (Hermes).

# Why choose Mercury?
Mercury greatly enhances the performance of Minecraft whilst reducing RAM usage, to assist laptops and low-end PCs. **I will not be comparing speeds between other mod packs** as it's practically impossible to host a fair benchmark, especially with varying results across PCs. But, I do encourage *you* to test performance speed across other mod packs ([Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), [FO](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), [SO](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), [OF](https://optifine.net/downloads)) to see which works best for your PC.

# Forge Support
**Mercury is the first-ever performance Modpack to run on Forge**, with the same FPS improvement as Fabric. We do this by using Fabric/Forge mods, as well as utilizing ports of Fabric mods, which has gotten more popular in recent years. **So if you intend to use Mercury to make your own Modpack, Forge Support has your back, allowing you to use all the mods!**

# Support the Mod Developers
Please remember that all of this is only possible because of the hardworking mod developers. Thank them, not us. Every one of the mods we use contributes to the performance of the pack. **If you enjoy the Mercury, go support the developers of the mods we used! Download their mods! Give them good feedback!**
