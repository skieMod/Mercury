# **Mercury**
Mercury is a simple, lightweight, **Minecraft Performance Modpack**, whose goal is to provide players with a significant FPS boost, while sustaining the quality and charm of Minecraft. It is created strictly for performance; **no Quality of Life, no OptiFine features, no game-breaking visual adjustments, just speed**. You can use Mercury both by itself for a vanilla FPS boost, as well as a foundation, a base model you can add onto to create your own mod pack. This is why **Mercury has support for both Fabric and Forge (never seen before)**, so that you can have increased FPS with any mods you desire.
